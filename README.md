# 66-135 Grand Challenge First Year Seminar: 66-135 Designing Better Human-AI Futures
### Spring 2022: Tues & Thurs, 11:50am-1:10pm (GHC 4102) **Zoom link on Canvas (until Feb 1)**

 - **All assignments will be on and submitted through [canvas](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/27949)**
 - **Class communication and announcements will be primarily through email and Slack**

### Course Description
How do we design AI systems that work for everyone and help create a more equitable society? Who needs to be involved in desgining these systems? Designers? Engineers? Social Scientists? Computer Scientists? Statisticians? Policymakers? The Public? What should the AI systems be designed to do and achieve? How do they affect society? How should they affect society? What role can all of us play in creating a future where AI can help us become a more equitable society?

In this class, hrough creating, sharing, watching, debating, playing, discussing, engaging, observing, and reading, we will go over these types of questions, exploring and discussing what AI is, how it affects society, how it's designed today, and how it could and possibly shoud be designed. 

Buzzwords we may use in this class: Artificial Intelligence, Design (Human-Centered Design, Iterative Design, Participatory Design, Value-Sensitive Design), Values(Social, Ethical, Policy, Business), Stakeholders

### What we want students to learn
- Develop your critical and analytical acumen on issues related to AI and how it impacts people, the public, and society
- Familiarize yourself with how AI systems are affecting different aspects of society
- Understand how these AI systems are being designed, developed, and evaluated today
- Collaborate with diverse and representative stakeholders that should be involved in the design of AI systems
- Explore how these AI systems could (and should) be designed, developed, and evaluated
- Develop and Communicate your perspectives on AI systems to a broad audience

### Class Structure and Topics
This class introduces students to the opportunities and challenges in building human-AI collaborative decision-making systems for societal domains such as health, education, criminal justice, transportation, education, and employment.  We take a design approach to issues around the development of AI systems, including working with communities and stakeholders to identify what the AI system is being designed to achieve, designing the system to attempt to achieve those values, and evaluating it on how it impacts humans and society.  We approach the design of AI as a system that needs continual improvement and redesign in order to reduce the risk of biases that may be inherent not only in the data acquired to develop the AI system, but also the biases of the teams that design the AI algorithms, the biases in the design of the AI algorithms themselves, as well as biases in how actions are taken using the outputs of the AI system.  

**Module 1: Intro and Primer on AI and Design Thinking**
- Intro to AI
  - AI and Society Case Studies
  - What is AI?
  - What can it do?
  - How does it do what it does?
  - How is it designed?
- Intro to Design Thinking, Human-Centered Design, and Participatory Research Methods
  - …
  - …

**Module 2: What values should an AI system have?**
- Intro to ethics and value systems
- Examples
- How to infer the values of an existing system?
- How to collaboratively and inclusively determine the values a system should have?

**Module 3: How do you design an AI system to achieve its intended values?**
- What components should you include?
- How should each component be designed?
- What data should the system use?
- What goals should it have?
- How should it be instructed/programmed to achieve those goals?

**Module 4: How do you validate that the AI system achieved those values?**
- What should the evaluation methodology be?
- What role do qualitative methods play?
- What role do quantitative methods play?
- Examples and Case Studies

**Module 5: How do you detect biases and what can you do to mitigate its equity impacts?**
- What does it mean for an AI system to be biased?
- Sources of bias in AI systems
- How to detect the different types of biases
- How to reduce them?
- How to mitigate their equity impact?
